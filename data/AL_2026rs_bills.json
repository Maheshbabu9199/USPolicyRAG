Synthetic controlled substances or synthetic\ncontrolled substance analogues are being manufactured,\ndistributed, possessed, and used as substitutes for controlled\nsubstances.\n(2) The hazards attributable to the traffic in and use\nof a synthetic controlled substance or synthetic controlled\nsubstance analogues are increased because their unregulated\nmanufacture produces variations in purity and concentration.\n(3) Many new synthetic substances are untested, and it\ncannot be immediately determined whether they have useful\nmedical or chemical purposes.\n(4) The uncontrolled importation, manufacture,\ndistribution, possession, or use of controlled substance\nanalogues has a substantial and detrimental impact on the\nhealth and safety of the people of this state.\n(5) Synthetic controlled substances or synthetic\ncontrolled substance analogues can be created more rapidly\nthan they can be identified and controlled by action of the\nLegislature. There is a need for a speedy determination of\ntheir proper classification under existing law.

The filing fee shall be refundable, less any\nadministrative expenses incurred, if the initiative is\nsuccessfully adopted or enacted.\n(2) The preliminary filing must be in the name of an\nindividual qualified elector who becomes the registered agent\nfor the proposition. The named individual registered agent is\nthe responsible party for any future filings and must file any\nelection reports and disclosures required by the election laws\nin the same manner as a candidate seeking elected office.

No later than the third\nlegislative day, the Secretary of State shall prepare and\ndisseminate to all members of the Legislature a complete list\nof the official summaries of all timely filed proposals. Upon\nrequest by any individual member of the Legislature, the\nSecretary of State shall provide a copy of the full text of\nthe proposal to the member.

The final petition\nmust be signed by qualified Alabama voters in a number that\nequals at least seven percent of the total votes cast for\nGovernor in the last preceding gubernatorial general election.\nEach petition shall contain a minimum number of signatures of\nqualified Alabama voters from each congressional district in\nthe state equal to one percent of the total votes cast for\nGovernor in the last preceding gubernatorial general election\nwithin each district. The Secretary of State shall verify that\nthe name and address of each qualified Alabama voter signing\nthe final petition are the same or substantially similar to\nthe name and address that appear on the registered voter list.\nThe 1,000 signatures contained on the preliminary petition may\nbe used toward the total requirement for the final petition.\n(g) Once the required signatures are obtained, the\nregistered agent shall submit a copy of the full text of the\nproposal, the summary, and final petition to the Secretary of\nState.

The Legislature, upon\nconsidering the proposal for the enactment of a general bill\nby the initiative, may not alter or amend the original\nproposal; however, the Legislature may offer an alternate\nproposal to be considered in the same manner. If the\nLegislature does not enact the proposal by 12:01 a.m. of the\n30th legislative day, the proposal shall be placed on the\nballot by the Secretary of State. If the Legislature approves\nan alternate proposal, both the original proposal from the\ninitiative process and the alternate legislative proposal\nshall be placed on the ballot.

The\ninitiative proposal for a general law enacted by the\nLegislature shall become law effective upon delivery to the\nSecretary of State, or upon the terms of the initiative.

Both the ballot\ntitle and the official summary for the ballot shall be\nimpartial and not likely to create prejudice for or against\nthe measure and shall be prepared in consultation with the\ninitiative committee and proponents. The initiative shall be\nsent to the Secretary of State for inclusion in the\nappropriate election.\n(j) No law adopted by the initiative under this\namendment shall be repealed or amended except by vote of the\npeople, unless it is otherwise provided by its terms.\nPart III. (a) The people may propose a constitutional\namendment with statewide application by filing a preliminary\npetition containing a summary of the proposal with the\nSecretary of State and proceeding further in the same manner\nand with the same requirements and following the same\nprocedures as for the petition process and the proposal of a\ngeneral law outlined in Part II, including the refund of the\nfiling fee, less any administrative expenses incurred, for an\ninitiative that is successfully adopted; provided, however,\nthe petition must be signed by qualified Alabama voters and\nverified as outlined in Part II. The total number of\nsignatures on the final petition required for a proposed\nconstitutional amendment must equal at least 10 percent of the\ntotal votes cast for Governor in the last preceding\ngubernatorial general election. Each final petition shall\ncontain a minimum number of signatures of qualified Alabama\nvoters from each congressional district in the state equal to\n1.3 percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the last\npreceding gubernatorial general election within each district.\nThe Legislature may approve an alternative amendment which\nshall appear on the ballot at the same time following the same\nprocedure as for a general law in Part II.\n(b) The proposal and any alternative shall be\nsubmitted to the qualified voters at the first statewide\nelection held 90 days or more after the measure qualifies;\nhowever, a special election may not be called solely for the\npurpose of a voter initiative proposal.\n(c) No measure proposed pursuant to this part of this\namendment shall be sent to the Governor, but shall be sent\ndirectly to the Legislative Services Agency, Legal Division,\nfor preparation of a review and comment, including an official\nsummary of the proposal for use on the ballot. Both the ballot\ntitle and the official summary shall be impartial and not\nlikely to create prejudice for or against the measure and\nshall be prepared in consideration with the initiative\ncommittee and proponents. The initiative shall be sent to the\nSecretary of State for inclusion in the appropriate election.\n(d) A proposed amendment or the legislative\nalternative shall become part of this constitution if approved\nby a majority of electors voting on the proposal.\n(e) If two constitutional amendments proposed\nseparately by the initiative procedure relating to essentially\nthe same subject appear on the ballot and are adopted, the\namendment which receives the highest number of affirmative\nvotes shall prevail to the extent of any conflict and shall be\nproclaimed upon the date of ratification.\n(f) No more than two pieces of legislation proposed\npursuant to this amendment may be enacted by the Legislature\npursuant to this amendment in any legislative session. If more\nthan two pieces of legislation are proposed, the two pieces of\nlegislation which may be enacted or placed on the ballot shall\nbe the two proposals having the greatest number of signatures.\nIf a proposal by initiative, whether a general bill or an\namendment to the Constitution of Alabama of 2022, has an\nalternative proposal made by the Legislature, the ballot\nlanguage shall be as follows:\nDo you favor amending general law or proposing a\nconstitutional amendment regarding _____?\nYes ___ No ___\nWhich change do you prefer?\n____ (A) The change proposed by the initiative process\nwhich _________.\n____ (B) The change offered as an alternative proposal\nwhich _______.\nPart IV. If an initiative proposed by Part II or Part\nIII fails to be adopted or approved pursuant to the process\nprovided in this amendment, an identical initiative may not be\nresubmitted sooner than two years following the failure of the\nprior initiative.\nUpon ratification of this constitutional amendment,\nthe Code Commissioner shall number and place this amendment as\nappropriate in the constitution omitting this instructional\nparagraph and may make the following nonsubstantive revisions:\nchange capitalization, hierarchy, spelling, and punctuation\nfor purposes of style and uniformity; correct manifest\ngrammatical, clerical, and typographical errors; revise\ninternal or external citations and cross-references; harmonize\nlanguage; and translate effective dates.\nSection 2. An election upon the proposed amendment\nshall be held in accordance with Sections 284 and 285 of the\nConstitution of Alabama of 2022, and the election laws of this\nstate. The appropriate election official shall assign a ballot\nnumber for the proposed constitutional amendment on the\nelection ballot and shall set forth the following description\nof the substance or subject matter of the proposed\nconstitutional amendment:\n\"Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of Alabama\nof 2022, providing that the people may initiate the enactment\nof certain general laws or constitutional amendments and that\nthe Legislature may offer an alternative proposal.\nProposed by Act ________.\"\nThis description shall be followed by the following\nlanguage:\n\"Yes ( )   No ( ).\"\nSection 3.
